## Overview

The **Student Adaptability Prediction Web App** is a Streamlit application designed to forecast a student's likelihood of adapting to online learning environments. By taking in student-specific information through a user-friendly form, the app employs a pre-trained machine learning model to categorize their adaptability level as either **'High'** or **'Low'**.

This application serves as a valuable tool for:

*   **Educators**: To proactively identify students who may require additional support in online learning settings.
*   **Educational Institutions**:  To understand and address the factors influencing student adaptability, optimizing online learning programs.
*   **Policymakers**: To gain insights into the broader trends affecting online learning adaptability and inform educational strategies.
